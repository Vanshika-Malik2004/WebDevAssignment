            <h2>Childhood</h2>
            <p>
              I was born in Meerut, a city rich in culture and history, but
              spent most of my childhood growing up in the vibrant and
              fast-developing city of Greater Noida. My schooling took place at
              Aster Public School, where I not only excelled academically but
              also embraced a wide range of extracurricular activities. I was an
              active participant in debates, often challenging myself to think
              critically and speak persuasively on a variety of topics. Drama
              became another passion of mine, where I found joy in expressing
              emotions and telling stories on stage. I wasn't just involved in
              traditional competitions; I took part in symposiums, where I got
              the opportunity to present ideas, collaborate with others, and
              develop a broader understanding of different subjects.
              <br />
              Outside of school, I loved exploring nature and taking long walks
              around the green parks of Greater Noida. My time at Aster Public
              School also taught me leadership, as I often volunteered for
              organizing school events and activities. The combination of
              academic learning and these enriching experiences has shaped who I
              am today, fostering a strong sense of curiosity and creativity.

            <h2>Engineering Journey</h2>
            <p>
              I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at IIIT
              Lucknow, where I’ve developed a strong interest in artificial
              intelligence and web development. Over the years, I’ve worked on
              various projects, including InvigoPulse and ServiceSync, where
              I’ve honed my skills using modern frameworks like React, NodeJS,
              Supabase, and even blockchain technologies like Solidity. I’m
              particularly proud of my competitive coding journey, having solved
              over 600+ problems on platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode,
              which has really sharpened my problem-solving skills. Alongside my
              technical pursuits, I’ve been active in societies and mentorship
              roles, which has allowed me to not only learn but also share
              knowledge with my peers. I’m passionate about contributing to
              meaningful tech projects and always looking for new ways to
              challenge myself and grow professionally.

              I love diving into real-life-based books; they give me a fresh
              perspective and connect me with stories that resonate. And of
              course, spending time with my friends, catching up on life, and
              sharing stories is something I value a lot. It keeps me grounded
              and recharged.
